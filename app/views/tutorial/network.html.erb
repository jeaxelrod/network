    <h2>Making Networks</h2>
    <p>The player who makes a complete network first wins!</p>
    <p>A network is a connected sequence of six or more chips that starts in one of your goal areas and ends in the other</p>
    <p>Chips are connected to each if there is a clear path vertically, horizontally, or diagonally</p>
    <p>Let's looks at some examples</p>
    <table class="mini_board">
      <tbody>
        <tr class="row0">
          <td class="board_square board_square0"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square10"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square20"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square30"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="row1">
          <td class="board_square board_square1"><div class="chip black"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square11"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square21"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square31"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="row2">
          <td class="board_square board_square2 highlight"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square12"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square22"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square32"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="row3">
          <td class="board_square board_square3"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square12"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square22"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square32"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>There are three connections to the <span class="yellow">highlighted</span> chip. Notice that a black chip blocks one of the connections</p>
    <p>Futhermore, a network cannot pass through the same chip twice</p>
    <p>A network can only have the two chips in the goal area: the first and last chip in the network</p>
    <p>And a network cannot pass through a chip without changing direction</p>
    <table class="mini_board">
      <tbody>
        <tr class="row0">
          <td class="board_square board_square0"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square10"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square20"></td>
          <td class="board_square board_square30"><div class="chip white"></div></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>If a network included these chips, it wouldn't be valid because it doesn't change directions after the first connection</p>
    <p>Let's look at a valid network</p>
    <%= react_component "Board", type: "local", id: @network_board_id, player: "white", chips: @network_chips %>
    <%= react_component "NetworkHighlighter", network: @networks %>
    <p><%= @networks[:black] %></p>
